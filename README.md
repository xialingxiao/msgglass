A consumer which tails log files or consume from kafka and reacts accordingly with respect to each handler inside a particular scripts directory.

The test suite generates log entries to `test/src/*.log` and uses the consumer to moniter those files and reacts accordingly. To run the test suite, use the following commands in sequence in different terminals at project directory:

```
nodejs test/test.js
```

```
nodejs consumer.js test/info.json
```

The logs generated by the consumer will be in `test/logs/`
